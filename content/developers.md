Source code
-----------

Source code specific to Bahmni is in GitHub under the [Bahmni project](https://github.com/bhamni). We are also closely involved in the [OpenMRS community](http://openmrs.org/), and contribute to several repositories in [OpenMRS](https://github.com/openmrs). 

Most of us currently work on a vagrant VM. A detailed procedure to set up a machine is in the works. The general idea is to download a centos box file and use the puppet scripts available in [bahmni-environment](github.com/bhamni/bahmni-environment) to create an initial setup. 

Current packages can be downloaded from our [CI server](https://ci-bahmni.thoughtworks.com/go/home).

Note: There are a few rough edges to be smoothened in the machine setup. Please contact us via our mailing lists if you are interested in setting this up.
