  <p>OpenSource Hospital Information System</p>
</header>
<section>
  <p><strong>Bahmni</strong> is an open source hospital information system under development for last one year. This  system is aimed to also work in low resource environments. It integrates a few of open source products - <strong>OpenMRS</strong>, <strong>OpenERP</strong>, <strong>OpenELIS</strong> and <strong>JasperReports</strong> to create a complete hospital system. OpenMRS, OpenERP and OpenELIS provide the clinical/medical record, hospital administration and laboratory functionality respectively. While this system caters to complete requirements of a hospital but Bahmni can be used in parts too. Bahmni is currently deployed at <a href="http://jssbilaspur.org/">JSS</a>.</p>
  <p>Bahmni currently has registration, billing, inventory and lab modules working in an integrated fashion, being used at JSS. The team is currently working on creating out patient module which is planned to be deployed at JSS begining next year.</p>
  <p>Bahmni team is actively working with OpenMRS to create a new user interface for OpenMRS which could be used at point of care. This code gets directly contributed to OpenMRS at https://github.com/openmrs. We have made significant performance/stability improvements in OpenELIS. </p>
